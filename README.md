# FIRE298-QML-Boycott-Superbowl
Currently we are working on implementing various error correction schemes, including Cascade, LDPC, Turbo Code, and Winnow, in to our BB84 code. We hope to then train an ML model that predicts the best error correction scheme given certain inputs such as Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) and key rate.
